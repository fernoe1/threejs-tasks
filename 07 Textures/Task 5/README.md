Create a cube. Enable orbit controls. Create LoadingManager to handle global loading state. Initialize TextureLoader with LoadingManager, load all the textures in textures directory. When using LoadingManager, log onStart, onLoad, onProgress, onError states using console.log().



Install lil-gui, initialize gui, give name to the gui, create a cube folder. Create dropdown for all textures. Create minFilter and magFilter dropdowns with linear and nearest filters. (Hint: When changing textures, listen to debugObject filters.)



You must have CSS that makes your canvas take whole screen.



You must have resize event listener that listens to resizes.



You must have H keypress event listener that shows/hides debug GUI.



RECOMMENDATION: Instead of continuing from the previous tasks, rewrite the whole code again, to memorize the syntax.
